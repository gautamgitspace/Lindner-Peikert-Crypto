# Lindner-Peikert-Crypto
Comparative study of Lattice-based cryptographic algorithms and evaluating their performance by testing them on constrained device environment (Raspberry Pi B+). Programmed the following algorithms in Python and C:

1. LP
2. U-LP
3. Bliss
4. NTRU

Analyzed their 'Quantum Safe' performance by running the executables on a modern computer system and  on basic constrained device hardware

This contains code for LP cryptographic scheme for Lattice Based Cryptography Approach 

Code for LP cryptographic scheme that is thought of to be useful for securing the devices in the Post-Quantum Era. Includes components for Keygen, Encrypt and Decrypt.
